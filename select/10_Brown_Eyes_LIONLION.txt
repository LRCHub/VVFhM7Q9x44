I noticed, you and I
My heart is still alive
I notice, you and I
Ooooooh

Unnoticed, my love is unnoticed

Every atom shows
I am irradiated
A beautiful glow
I'm in love

Every heartbeat knows
I am captivated
As if turned to stone
I'm in love

I can't get a grip on my irrationality
I'm lost for words, lost for words
I've never made it clear to you
In actuality I'm not speaking up
I'm diffident

When I see your brown eyes
I notice, I notice my heart is still alive
When I see your doe eyes
I notice, I notice my love is

Unnoticed, my love is unnoticed

Every emotion says
Logic is overrated
Under your spell
I'm in love

Wanna let you know
I wanna make you notice
But I'm spinning round
Spiraling

I can't get a grip on my irrationality
I'm lost for words, I'm spiraling
I've never made it clear to you
In actuality I'm not speaking up, 'cause I'm diffident

When I see your brown eyes
I notice, I notice my heart is still alive
When I see your doe eyes
I notice, I notice my heart is still alive

I notice, You and I
My heart is still alive
I notice, You and I
Ooooooh

My love is unnoticed
