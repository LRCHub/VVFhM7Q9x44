[00:11.75] Tell me and take your time.
[00:18.13] Set free this soul of mine.
[00:24.44] Freeze frame this sedate moment.
[00:31.70] Lie me in your quiet ground.
[00:45.70] 
[00:37.18] I understand your
[00:40.74] Tired eyes for these
[00:45.39] Tired homes and tired trees.
[00:50.73] I see the pain in those
[00:54.38] Brown eyes.
[00:59.71] Fires burn in autumn skies.
